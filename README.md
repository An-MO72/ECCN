# Trading Platform

## Description
This project is a trading platform designed for exchanging objects that are no longer needed. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can create listings for objects they want to trade and browse existing listings to find items they are interested in. The platform is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.

## Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and log out securely.
- Listing Creation: Users can create listings for objects they want to trade by providing relevant details such as item description, category, and condition.
- Listing Browsing: Users can browse existing listings to find items they are interested in. They can filter listings by category or search for specific keywords.
- Messaging: Users can communicate with each other by sending messages related to a specific listing.
- User Profiles: Each user has a profile page displaying their active listings and trade history.
- Notifications: Users receive notifications for new messages, trade requests, and status updates of their listings.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: Python web framework for building the application.
- SQLite: Lightweight relational database management system used for storing user information, listings, and messages.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Front-end technologies for designing and styling the user interface.
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for responsive and mobile-friendly design.
